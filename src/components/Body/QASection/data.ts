    description:
      'Tools alone don’t create growth the environment does. Many apps let you store certificates, write notes, or track skills, but they exist inside ecosystems filled with noise, comparison, and negativity. \nVloree combines powerful tools with a positive-only community, so your progress isn’t disrupted or overshadowed.',
